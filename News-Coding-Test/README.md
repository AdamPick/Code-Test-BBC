# News-Coding-Test
I didn't manage to get onto the ranking system for the pages. If I had done I would have stored the pages as separate IDs based on their titles and that placed them on screen next to radio buttons in an onscreen matrix from which the user can choose off a scale from worst (5) and best (5).

I had a few bugs when displaying images and this clearly shows my lack of experience with javascript but I believe this test has helped me considerably.
